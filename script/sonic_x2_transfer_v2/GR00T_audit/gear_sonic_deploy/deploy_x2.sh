# X2 Ultra Deploy - Deployment Script
# ============================================================================
# Companion to deploy.sh (which targets G1). End-to-end build + pre-flight +
# launch for the agi_x2_deploy_onnx_ref ROS 2 package on AgiBot X2 Ultra.
#
# Topologies (per docs/source/user_guide/x2_sonic_deploy_real.md):
#   local  - Build and run on this machine (your laptop). DDS auto-discovers
#            the robot via the wired SDK ethernet (laptop NIC at 10.0.1.2/24,
#            PC2 dev unit at 10.0.1.41). The C++ deploy, MC stop/start
#            helpers, RAMP_OUT trap, hand bridge and recorder all live on
#            the laptop. Requires the wired link.
#   onbot  - Run NATIVELY on PC2 (the robot's onboard Jetson Orin NX). This
#            script is expected to be executed on PC2 itself -- launched
#            via ssh from the laptop, typically inside a tmux session
#            (see scripts/x2_pc2_daemons.sh). Everything bash-side
#            (Y/n safety gate, MC stop_app/start_app via PC1 EM HTTP
#            or `aima em` CLI fallback, sentinel handoff, RAMP_OUT trap,
#            HOLD_FOR_MC handoff) AND the C++ deploy run on the same
#            shell on PC2, so the orchestration survives a laptop-side
#            WiFi disconnect mid-run. Assumes ``pc2_bringup.sh`` has
#            already staged the colcon workspace, Python venv, ONNX
#            Runtime and ONNX policies under ``$ONBOT_PREFIX`` (default
#            /home/run/gear-sonic). The hand bridge and motor monitor are
#            launched separately by x2_pc2_daemons.sh (so they share
#            the same lifecycle as the deploy but in their own tmux
#            sessions). The recorder lives on the laptop with the
#            planner stack and is not touched here.
#   sim    - Build + run locally against a MuJoCo physics sim, on isolated
#            loopback DDS (ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1 + private ROS_DOMAIN_ID).
#            The sibling Python bridge scripts/x2_mujoco_ros_bridge.py is
#            launched in the background; it steps physics at 1 kHz, publishes
#            joint state + IMU on the same /aima/* topics the deploy
#            subscribes to, and applies the deploy's PD commands as MuJoCo
#            torques. This is the X2 analogue of G1's sim mode (which
#            selects a loopback DDS interface and pairs with the
#            unitree_sdk2py MuJoCo bridge).
#
# Local/onbot pre-flight:
#   1. Ping PC2 to confirm we can reach the robot (local mode only;
#      onbot mode is already ON PC2 so this is skipped).
#   2. Verify ROS 2 topics are visible (joint state for each group + IMU).
#   3. Stop the MC module by POSTing stop_app to PC1's Environment Manager
#      HTTP API (the same mechanism `aima em stop-app mc` uses underneath).
#      On firmware where the HTTP endpoint has been removed (the EM service
#      moved to ROS 2 services in late 2026), `mc_em_post` falls back to
#      `aima em stop-app mc` / `aima em start-app mc` on PC2's PATH.
#      Use --no-stop-mc to skip.
#
# Sim pre-flight:
#   1. Verify the bridge script + MJCF + Python deps are importable.
#   2. Isolate DDS to loopback so a sim run on the SDK subnet cannot fight a
#      real robot (sets ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1 and ROS_DOMAIN_ID).
#
# Usage:
#   ./deploy_x2.sh [OPTIONS] [local|onbot|sim]
#
# Examples:
#   ./deploy_x2.sh --model /opt/x2_models/model_step_016000_g1.onnx --dry-run
#   ./deploy_x2.sh --model ./model.onnx --motion ./standing.x2m2 onbot

#              right starting point for the first powered Quest 3 teleop run
#              (operator-driven motion = "new motion playlist" by the rule).
#   * 0.80  -- the expressive.yaml preset; switch to this once conservative
#              has cleared on the same model+motion class (paired with
#              --target-lpf-hz 8 for real-sensor jitter tame).
#   * 1.50  -- the value used for the first iter-22000 powered walk
#              (2026-05-03 casual_walk_v1) and shipped in the published
#              sim-to-real anchors b/c/d. Settled "play freely" value once

# wrapper does NOT block these flags in sim mode the way it blocks

# MuJoCo before pushing to robot; just be aware that doing so DEFEATS
# sim-profile parity with eval_x2_mujoco.py for the duration of that run.
#
# Why this exists: IsaacLab integrates PD implicitly against the joint-
# space inertia + armature at training, while MuJoCo and real X2 apply
# explicit ctrl-driven torque, so the same numerical KP behaves softer

# End-of-run smooth handoff (HOLD_FOR_MC).
#
# The deploy node has a HOLD_FOR_MC state that, after RAMP_OUT lands the
# joints at MC's STAND_DEFAULT pose, keeps publishing that pose at the
# captured MC kp/kd until MC retakes the joint command bus. The bash
# wrapper sequences this end-of-run dance:
#
#   1. RAMP_OUT completes ->
#      deploy node touches HOLD_FOR_MC_SENTINEL and enters HOLD_FOR_MC.
#   2. The polling loop below sees the sentinel and POSTs start_app +
#      SetMcAction(STAND_DEFAULT) WHILE the deploy node is still actively
#      holding the pose. No zero-torque window.
#   3. MC boots and starts publishing on /aima/hal/joint/{leg,waist}/command.
#   4. The deploy node's MC-takeover detector sees a non-self publisher
#      and exits cleanly. We `wait` on its PID for the final exit code.
#
# The sentinel file lives in $RUN_LOG_DIR (or /tmp as fallback). It is
# unlinked on every entry to HOLD_FOR_MC by the deploy node and on every
# exit from this script (cleanup trap), so a stale file from a previous
# crashed run cannot mis-trigger the next run.
#
# STAND_POSE_YAML defaults to gear_sonic_deploy/configs/x2_stand_default_pose.yaml,
# which is captured from MC by scripts/x2_capture_stand_pose.py (or by the
# inline capture run from chat). HOLD_FOR_MC_TIMEOUT_S is the cap on how
# long the deploy node will keep holding the pose if MC never comes back
# (covers a failed start_app POST). Both are passthroughs to the C++
# binary's --stand-default-pose / --hold-for-mc-timeout-s / --hold-for-mc-sentinel
# flags. Set HOLD_FOR_MC_TIMEOUT_S=0 to disable HOLD_FOR_MC entirely

Deploy the agi_x2_deploy_onnx_ref ROS 2 node onto an AgiBot X2 Ultra.

Modes:
  local           Build + run on this machine; talk to robot via DDS over
                  the wired SDK ethernet (default).
  onbot           Run NATIVELY on PC2 (the robot's onboard Jetson Orin
                  NX). Expects pc2_bringup.sh to have staged the
                  workspace + venv + ONNX Runtime under \$ONBOT_PREFIX
                  (default $ONBOT_PREFIX_DEFAULT). Bash orchestration,
                  MC stop/start, sentinel handoff and the deploy all
                  run on PC2 in the same shell, so the lifecycle
                  survives a laptop-side WiFi disconnect. Recommended
                  for split-topology production runs; pair with
                  scripts/x2_pc2_daemons.sh as the launcher.
  sim             Build + run locally on isolated loopback DDS, paired with
                  the MuJoCo bridge (scripts/x2_mujoco_ros_bridge.py)
                  launched as a background child. Bridge steps physics at
                  1 kHz, publishes joint state + IMU on the same /aima
                  topics the deploy subscribes to, and applies the deploy's
                  PD commands as MuJoCo torques. Closed-loop. Mirrors what
                  G1's sim mode does via unitree_sdk2py_bridge.

Required:
  --model PATH                Fused g1+g1_dyn ONNX (e.g. *_g1.onnx)

Optional deploy flags (forwarded to ros2 run):
  --motion PATH               Reference motion. Accepts .pkl (motion-lib),
                              .yaml (warehouse playlist), or .x2m2 (deploy
                              runtime format). PKL/YAML are baked on the fly
                              to a tempdir .x2m2 the deploy binary loads;
                              the same source PKL/YAML is auto-passed to the
                              MuJoCo bridge as --sim-motion (in sim mode) so
                              both consumers see bit-identical motion data
                              with no risk of drift. Pass an .x2m2 directly
                              for legacy/already-baked artefacts. Default:
                              StandStillReference (NOT recommended for
                              policies trained on motion).
  --log-dir PATH              Per-tick CSV log directory
  --record                    Background-record the full robot run (state +
                              command + IMU on /aima/hal/*) to an .npz for
                              post-mortem analysis. Recorder starts before
                              the deploy launches, stops on script exit
                              (Ctrl-C-safe: trap finalises the npz). Output
                              defaults to --log-dir/run.npz, or
                              <repo>/scratch/runs/x2_run_<ts>/run.npz when
                              --log-dir is unset (host bind-mounted so it
                              survives container --rm; never /tmp inside
                              docker -- that's the ephemeral writable layer).
                              Use scripts/x2_record_real_run.py --summarize
                              PATH.npz to print the cmd/state/track-err
                              tables.
  --record-out PATH           Implies --record. Override the .npz output path.
  --tuning-config PATH        REAL-ROBOT ONLY (rejected in sim mode). Loads a
                              YAML preset from
                              gear_sonic_deploy/configs/real_deploy_tuning/
                              and expands it to deploy-binary CLI flags
                              (--max-target-dev, --target-lpf-hz, etc.).
                              Explicit flags on this command line still win
                              over the preset (they appear later in argv and
                              the binary's parser is last-write-wins). Sim
                              profiles deliberately refuse this flag so the
                              C++<->Python parity surface against
                              eval_x2_mujoco.py cannot be silently changed.

                              obs-construction bug cannot drive any joint
                              more than RAD away from the trained standing
                              pose, regardless of what the ONNX session emits.
                              Acts as the GLOBAL default for joints with no
                              per-group override below.
  --max-target-dev-leg RAD    Per-group override (MJ joints 0..11 = both
                              hips, knees, ankles). >0 wins over the global
                              --max-target-dev for these joints; omitted =
                              inherit the global. Typical pairing for VR
                              teleop: leg=0.30 (~17 deg), arm=1.50 (~86 deg).
                              Legs need to stay tight: kp ~99 Nm/rad means
                              the same nominal travel produces ~7x the
                              torque arms do.
  --max-target-dev-waist RAD  Per-group override (MJ joints 12..14 = waist
                              yaw/pitch/roll). Same semantics as --leg.
  --max-target-dev-arm RAD    Per-group override (MJ joints 15..28 = both
                              shoulders, elbows, wrists). Set this loose
                              (e.g. 1.50) for teleop where IK can drive
                              the wrist far from default.
  --max-target-dev-head RAD   Per-group override (MJ joints 29..30 = head
                              yaw, pitch). Same semantics as --leg.
  --kp-scale FACTOR           REAL-DEPLOY ONLY (parity-breaking in sim).
                              Multiplicative trim on every joint's KP.
                              Default 1.0 = ship trained kps[] from
                              policy_parameters.hpp as-is. The trained
                              KP is the value IsaacLab used at training;
                              IsaacLab integrates PD implicitly against
                              joint inertia + armature, so the same
                              numerical KP behaves softer at deploy
                              (MuJoCo + real X2 both apply explicit
                              ctrl). Symptom of leaving this at 1.0 on
                              the real robot: stands fine static, wobbles
                              when nudged. Standard fix: per-family bumps
                              below.
  --kp-scale-FAMILY FACTOR    Per-family override; FAMILY is one of
                              hip / knee / ankle / waist / shoulder /
                              elbow / wrist / head (substring match on
                              joint name; mirrors eval_x2_mujoco.py).
                              Effective scale on a joint = global *
                              family. The ankle and waist families have
                              FURTHER subgroup knobs (see below).
  --kp-scale-ankle-pitch FACTOR ankle_pitch_joint ONLY. Trained kp=21.38;
                              1.87 matches MC's 40 N*m/rad sagittal KP.
                              The G16b-validated default for fwd/back
                              recovery.
  --kp-scale-ankle-roll FACTOR ankle_roll_joint ONLY. Trained kp=21.38;
                              1.40 matches MC's 30 N*m/rad frontal KP.
                              Deliberately softer than pitch so sideways
                              disturbances absorb without snapping the
                              foot.
  --kp-scale-waist-yaw FACTOR waist_yaw_joint ONLY. Trained kp=40.18
                              matches MC's published 40 exactly, so the
                              typical value is 1.00 -- bumping is more
                              likely to ring than to help.
  --kp-scale-waist-pr FACTOR  waist_pitch + waist_roll. Trained kp=14.25
                              but MC publishes 40 N*m/rad -> 2.81 matches
                              MC exactly. This is the recommended knob
                              if you're chasing forward/back nudge
                              wobble. Pre-set in expressive.yaml.
  --kd-scale FACTOR           Same as --kp-scale but for damping.
                              Default 1.0 (no trim). Watch the kp/kd
                              ratio: bumping kp without kd lowers the
                              effective damping ratio. If a kp-bumped
                              run rings, try matching kd-scale 1.2 as
                              a first knob before backing off kp.
  --kd-scale-FAMILY FACTOR    Per-family kd override; same FAMILY set
                              as --kp-scale-FAMILY. The ankle and waist
                              families have split subgroup knobs (below).
  --kd-scale-ankle-pitch FACTOR ankle_pitch_joint ONLY. MC publishes
                              kd=3.0 vs trained 0.907 -> 3.31 matches
                              MC. Under-damped pitch is the usual cause
                              of 'foot-feels-springy' on fwd/back
                              ankle-direct nudges.
  --kd-scale-ankle-roll FACTOR ankle_roll_joint ONLY. MC publishes
                              kd=2.0 vs trained 0.907 -> 2.20 matches
                              MC. Less damping than pitch (frontal plane
                              is intrinsically more rigid).
  --kd-scale-waist-yaw FACTOR waist_yaw_joint ONLY. MC publishes kd=8.0
                              vs trained 2.56 -> 3.13 matches MC exactly.
  --kd-scale-waist-pr FACTOR  waist_pitch + waist_roll. MC publishes
                              kd=5.0 vs trained 0.907 -> 5.51 matches MC.
                              This is the SINGLE biggest knob for
                              closing the fwd/back nudge gap on the real
                              robot. Pre-set in expressive.yaml.
  --target-lpf-hz HZ          REAL-DEPLOY ONLY. First-order EMA cutoff (Hz)
                              applied to the published joint targets AFTER the
                              safety stack and BEFORE the bus, to tame jitter
                              caused by noisy real sensor obs. 0 = disabled
                              (default; preserves sim parity). Typically set
                              via --tuning-config; this CLI flag exists so
                              operators can override the preset for quick A/B
                              sweeps. The C++ binary's parser is
                              last-write-wins, so an explicit --target-lpf-hz
                              here always trumps whatever a tuning config set.
  --action-clip RAD           Symmetric clip on the raw ONNX action (action_il)
                              BEFORE x2_action_scale. Default in the C++ binary
                              is 20.0, matching the training-time
                              config.action_clip_value in
                              gear_sonic/config/manager_env/base_env.yaml.
                              Pass a negative value to disable (parity tests
                              only). Without this clip a saturated policy
                              produces O(100 rad) targets which the deploy
                              safety stack truncates -- silently breaking
                              parity with what training observed.
  --return-seconds SECONDS    Soft-EXIT ramp duration (default 2.0). When
                              --max-duration trips, lerp target_pos from the
                              last policy command back to default_angles over
                              SECONDS (deploy-mode kp/kd active) before
                              shutdown. Prevents MC from snapping joints back
                              at handoff (which can red-fault the X2 Ultra
                              MC unit if the policy left limbs mid-motion --
                              e.g. arm extended for take_a_sip). Set 0 to
                              disable (legacy immediate-shutdown).
  --imu-topic NAME            Override IMU topic; use this if the firmware
                              ships with the SDK-example typo
                              (/aima/hal/imu/torse/state)
  --raw-torso-imu             Disable torso-to-pelvis waist-chain correction
                              (diagnostic rollback only)
  --intra-op-threads N        ONNX session threads (default: 1)
  --obs-dump PATH             DEBUG: capture the first CONTROL-tick inference
                              payload (tokenizer + proprioception + raw action
                              + robot state) to PATH and exit. Pair with
                              --dry-run + --autostart-after for a deterministic
                              snapshot from a known robot pose. Diff against
                              IsaacLab GT with

Robot connection (onbot mode):
  --robot-host HOST           PC2 IP/hostname (default: $ROBOT_HOST_DEFAULT).
                              IGNORED in the current onbot mode -- onbot
                              runs natively on PC2, so there is no ssh
                              target. Kept for backward compatibility.
  --robot-user USER           PC2 ssh user (default: $ROBOT_USER_DEFAULT).
                              Same: ignored in onbot mode.
  --onbot-prefix DIR          PC2 install prefix (default: $ONBOT_PREFIX_DEFAULT).
                              All other onbot paths default to subdirs of
                              this; pass once to relocate the whole install
                              (matching pc2_bringup.sh --prefix).
  --onbot-ws PATH             colcon workspace on PC2 (default:
                              \$ONBOT_PREFIX/ws). Must contain
                              install/setup.bash built by pc2_bringup.sh.
  --onbot-venv PATH           Python venv on PC2 (default: \$ONBOT_PREFIX/venv).

                              with --system-site-packages so it inherits
                              the system rclpy and aimdk_msgs bindings.
  --onbot-onnxruntime PATH    Prebuilt ONNX Runtime install on PC2 (default:
                              \$ONBOT_PREFIX/onnxruntime). lib/ is added to
                              LD_LIBRARY_PATH so the deploy can dlopen
                              libonnxruntime.so.
  --onbot-aimdk-prefix PATH   aimdk_msgs install on PC2 (default:
                              $ONBOT_AIMDK_PREFIX_DEFAULT). cmake config,
                              libs and python bindings live here; added
                              to AMENT_PREFIX_PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH and
                              PYTHONPATH at launch.

                              pass before going to powered hardware):

                                           exactly. A correct C++ deploy
                                           MUST hold 30s clean here. Tests

                                           until the policy has full
                                           authority. Tests that the deploy

                                           supported powered runs, so sim
                                           and the real Phase 7-9 powered
                                           bring-up test the same operating
                                           point. Recommended as the FINAL
                                           sim gate before powered runs;
                                           closest sim analogue of the

                                manual  -- no auto-magic; whatever explicit
                                           flags the user passes are left
                                           alone. Default when --motion is
                                           a .x2m2 or omitted entirely.

  --sim-mjcf PATH             Override MJCF path (default: x2_ultra.xml).
  --sim-motion PATH           [DEPRECATED] RSI source for the bridge.
                              Prefer just passing --motion <pkl|yaml>; this
                              wrapper now auto-derives the bridge's RSI source
                              from --motion when it's a PKL or YAML. This
                              flag is retained for back-compat / explicit
                              overrides only.
  --sim-init-frame N          Motion frame to RSI from (default 0).
  --sim-viewer                Open the MuJoCo passive viewer window.
  --sim-cam-track-body NAME   Lock the passive viewer's camera onto the named
                              body (e.g. "pelvis") so the robot stays framed
                              as it walks. Default: free camera.
  --sim-cam-distance M        Tracking-camera distance in meters
                              (default: bridge picks 3.5).
  --sim-cam-elevation DEG     Tracking-camera elevation in degrees, negative
                              looks down (default: bridge picks -12).
  --sim-cam-azimuth DEG       Tracking-camera azimuth in degrees
                              (0=+X, 90=+Y, 180=-X, 270=-Y; default 135).
  --sim-with-omnihand         Make the MuJoCo bridge load the X2 + OmniHand
                              augmented MJCF (programmatically composed via
                              gear_sonic.scripts.compose_x2_with_omnihand)
                              instead of the bare x2_ultra.xml. Replaces the
                              dummy wrist stubs with the 10-active-DOF (per
                              side) OmniHand fingers. The body joints +
                              actuators are unchanged so the deploy harness's
                              joint-name handshake still passes.
  --sim-hand-zmq-host HOST    Host the bridge SUBs on for OmniHand finger
                              setpoints when --sim-with-omnihand is set.
                              Default 'localhost' (live VLA bridge).
  --sim-hand-zmq-port PORT    Port for the OmniHand SUB. Default 5556 -- the
                              same port the SONIC C++ harness already
                              subscribes to (PUB/SUB is multi-subscriber-
                              safe so they ride alongside).
  --sim-hand-zmq-topic STR    ZMQ topic prefix for the OmniHand SUB. Must
                              match the live VLA bridge's --pub-topic
                              (default 'pose').
  --sim-no-hand-zmq           Skip the OmniHand ZMQ subscriber even when
                              --sim-with-omnihand is set. Useful for static
                              viewer screenshots: fingers stay at the
                              MJCF rest pose.
  --sim-imu-from {pelvis,torso}
                              Body to read IMU from (default: pelvis,
                              matches MJCF live sensor at imu_0).
  --sim-hold-stiffness-mult X
                              Multiplier on policy_parameters.kps used to
                              hold the default standing pose BEFORE the
                              deploy connects (default: 1.0).
  --sim-init-pose {default,gantry-hang}
                              Bridge init pose when --motion is NOT set.
                              'default' = upright stand; 'gantry-hang' =
                              bent-knee crouch with pelvis_z=0.75m. Auto-
                              set by --sim-profile gantry; pass directly
                              for ad-hoc experimentation.
  --sim-band-length M         ElasticBand suspension length (m). Pull-target
                              sits at world [0, 0, 1.0 - LENGTH]. Default 0
                              (target above standing pelvis). Auto-set to
                              0.22 by --sim-profile gantry (target ~3 cm
                              above the bent pelvis at z=0.75).
  --sim-band-kp-mult X        Multiplier on the ElasticBand's kp_pos /
                              kd_pos. 1.0 = stiff (10000 / 1000); lower
                              values (0.3-0.5) make the suspension softer
                              / more forgiving. kd is scaled by sqrt(mult)
                              to preserve the damping ratio.
  --sim-no-elastic-band       Disable the virtual ElasticBand. The band is
                              ON by default and hangs the pelvis from world
                              [0,0,1] so the robot stays upright while the
                              policy spins up. With viewer, press 9 to drop;
                              headless, see --sim-band-release-after-s.
                              NOTE: when --motion resolves to a PKL/YAML
                              (i.e. the bridge can RSI from frame 0), this
                              wrapper auto-disables the band so the robot
                              spawns in stable contact equilibrium instead
                              of being suspended-then-dropped (the latter
                              produces a transient the policy was never
                              trained on; see x2_deploy_architecture.md).
                              Use --sim-keep-elastic-band to override.
  --sim-keep-elastic-band     Force the elastic band ON even when --motion
                              would otherwise auto-disable it. Useful for
                              testing the suspended-then-dropped scenario
                              explicitly.
  --sim-band-release-after-s SECS
                              When headless, auto-release the band SECS
                              seconds after the deploy's first command.
                              Default 1.0. Negative = never (unsafe).
  --sim-dt SECS               Physics step (default: 0.001 = 1 kHz).
  --sim-print-scene           Dump bodies/joints/actuators/sensors on start.
  --sim-python PATH           Python interpreter for the bridge
                              (default: repo .venv/bin/python when that
                              file is executable, else python3).
  --sim-record-commands PATH  Record the deploy's command topics to this
                              rosbag2 directory (handy for diffing sim/real).
  --sim-domain-id N           ROS_DOMAIN_ID to isolate the sim from any real
                              robot on the same subnet (default: $SIM_DOMAIN_ID_DEFAULT)

VLA / ZMQ input source (M2 acceptance gate, see
docs/source/references/x2_zmq_protocol.md):
  --vla                       Switch the deploy from "motion file replay" to
                              "ZMQ pose subscriber". Ignores --motion. Pair
                              with gear_sonic/scripts/vla/mock_vla_publish_stand_token.py
                              for a sim smoke test, or with the real GR00T
                              N1.7 VLA serving the X2 once trained.
  --vla-zmq-host HOST         Host of the VLA ZMQ pose publisher
                              (default: $VLA_ZMQ_HOST).
  --vla-zmq-port PORT         Port of the VLA ZMQ pose publisher
                              (default: $VLA_ZMQ_PORT).
  --vla-zmq-topic TOPIC       Topic prefix to subscribe to (default: $VLA_ZMQ_TOPIC).
  --vla-debug-port PORT       Port for the deploy's x2_debug PUB socket
                              (default: $VLA_DEBUG_PORT). Set 0 to disable.
                              dump_x2_debug.py is the reference subscriber.
  --vla-resume-host HOST      Host of the SAFE_IDLE resume PUB (the laptop
                              manager publishes when the Quest 3 operator
                              hits the A+B chord). Empty = leave the
                              resume socket disabled.
  --vla-resume-port PORT      Port for the resume PUB (default: $VLA_RESUME_PORT).
  --vla-resume-topic TOPIC    Topic prefix for resume frames
                              (default: $VLA_RESUME_TOPIC).
  --deploy-extra-arg ARG      Forward ARG verbatim to the C++ deploy binary.
                              Repeat for multiple args. Useful for new C++
                              CliArgs flags before they get a dedicated
                              wrapper flag here.
  --vla-debug-topic TOPIC     Topic prefix for x2_debug frames
                              (default: $VLA_DEBUG_TOPIC).
  --wrist-bypass MODE         {off, ik, freeze}. Forwarded to the deploy binary as
                              --wrist-bypass. When 'ik' (and --vla is set),
                              the deploy overwrites target_pos_mj for the
                              4 broken wrist DOFs (left/right wrist_pitch +
                              wrist_roll) with the latest IK reference from
                              the ZMQ pose feed BEFORE the safety stack.
                              SONIC still drives every other DOF including
                              wrist_yaw (which tracks correctly today).
                              Use 'ik' for VR teleop / VLA dataset recording
                              where SONIC's wrist attractor masks the
                              operator's hand pose; keep unset / 'off' for
                              sim-to-real fidelity tests. Default: empty
                              'freeze' pins all six wrist targets to the
                              trained default and matches Python --freeze-wrist.
                              (= binary default of 'off').
  --head-bypass MODE          {off, ref}. Forwarded to the deploy binary as
                              --head-bypass. When 'ref' (ZMQ pose feed
                              required), the deploy overwrites target_pos_mj
                              for the 2 head DOFs (head_yaw/head_pitch) with
                              the ZMQ reference BEFORE the safety stack.
                              SONIC's head tracking saturates at ~+-10 deg;
                              use 'ref' so the pad head-look overlay reaches
                              the joint. Default: empty (= binary 'off').

OmniHand bridge (REAL ROBOT, MODE=local only -- sim uses --with-omnihand instead):
  --no-hand-bridge            Skip auto-spawning the ZMQ -> AimDK
                              HandCommandArray bridge. The C++ deploy
                              never publishes /aima/hal/joint/hand/command
                              on its own, so without the bridge real-robot
                              teleop cannot close fingers (wire fields land
                              in x2_debug only). Default: bridge is ON.
                              Pass this for arm/leg-only sessions where
                              the hands aren't connected.
  --hand-bridge-sides STR     {auto,left,right,both,off}. 'auto' detects
                              attached sides from the latched HandStateArray
                              on /aima/hal/joint/hand/state. (default: auto)
  --hand-bridge-engage-shots N
                              Number of position=0 shots to fire at startup
                              so the OmniHand HAL exits its 'no command yet'
                              state and enables motors. Set 0 only when
                              piggy-backing on an already-engaged HAL.
                              (default: 3, 1Hz spacing)
  --hand-bridge-max-stale-s S Wire frame is considered stale after this
                              many seconds with no update. Stale -> the
                              bridge republishes last-good positions
                              instead of dribbling zeros. (default: 0.20s)
  --hand-bridge-publish-hz HZ Publish loop rate (default: 50, matches the
                              deploy CONTROL tick).
  --hand-bridge-python PATH   Python interpreter to launch the bridge with.
                              Default: same as other auxiliary Python in
                              this script (repo .venv/bin/python when that
                              file is executable, otherwise python3; in
                              docker_x2 the image python3 carries rclpy).

Pre-flight + behaviour toggles:
  --no-wire-probe             Skip the pre-MC-stop ZMQ wire-freshness probe.
                              The default probe SUBs to the deploy's actual
                              --vla-zmq-host/-port for --wire-probe-secs and
                              aborts if zero frames arrive (catches dead
                              pose proxy / missing planner stack BEFORE MC
                              is stopped). Disable for unattended CI / when
                              intentionally testing starvation.
  --ground-load-test-only    Suspended static-PD load test. The C++ process
                              rejects 'go' and accepts only 'load' followed by
                              'lifted'; Sonic policy inference stays disabled.
  --supported-policy-probe   Suspended, gantry-supported test: static 'load',
                              then an explicit bounded 5-second 'policy' pulse.
                              'stop' returns smoothly to the static hold.
  --supported-policy-seconds S
                              Override bounded policy duration.
  --supported-policy-ramp-seconds S
                              Static-to-policy ramp duration.
  --supported-policy-return-seconds S
                              Policy-to-static return duration.
  --supported-policy-max-dev-{leg,waist,arm,head} RAD
                              Per-group policy target clamp.
  --supported-policy-anchor-default
                              Center that clamp on trained default_angles and
                              ramp there from the captured static hold.
  --supported-policy-tilt-delta-deg DEG
                              Relative tilt automatic-return threshold.
  --supported-policy-abs-tilt-deg DEG
                              Absolute tilt automatic-return threshold.
  --supported-policy-joint-vel-trip RAD_S
                              Joint-speed automatic-return threshold.
  --supported-policy-target-rate RAD_S
                              Maximum supported-probe target slew rate.
  --wire-probe-secs SECONDS   How long the wire probe listens (default: 1.0).
  --no-stop-mc                Skip the stop_app POST (assume MC is already
                              stopped, or you're using JOINT_DEFAULT mode).
                              The cleanup trap that restarts MC on exit is
                              also skipped in that case.
  --no-require-stand-default  Bypass the pre-handoff gate that refuses to
                              start unless MC is currently in STAND_DEFAULT.
                              Use only if you know what you're doing -- the
                              smooth handoff (RAMP_OUT to STAND_DEFAULT pose
                              + HOLD_FOR_MC) assumes MC was actively
                              balancing the robot before bash takes the bus.
  --stand-pose-yaml PATH      YAML file capturing MC's STAND_DEFAULT pose
                              (default: configs/x2_stand_default_pose.yaml).
                              Forwarded to the deploy binary as
                              --stand-default-pose; controls the RAMP_OUT
                              + HOLD_FOR_MC target. Pass an empty string
                              to fall back to default_angles (legacy snap-
                              on-takeover behaviour).
  --hold-for-mc-timeout-s N   Maximum time the deploy node will keep
                              holding MC's STAND_DEFAULT pose after
                              RAMP_OUT, waiting for MC to take back over
                              the joint command bus (default 45). 0
                              disables HOLD_FOR_MC entirely (legacy:
                              deploy exits on RAMP_OUT, then bash starts
                              MC -- there will be a zero-torque window).
  --soft-shutdown-wait-s N    (Only relevant with --enable-soft-shutdown.)
                              Seconds the bash cleanup trap waits for
                              deploy to reach HOLD_FOR_MC after Ctrl-C
                              before falling through and POSTing
                              start_app anyway (default 6). Should be
                              larger than --return-seconds (RAMP_OUT
                              duration) plus a small DDS-discovery
                              margin. The wait is interruptible: a
                              second Ctrl-C bails immediately to the
                              legacy hard-exit path.
  --enable-soft-shutdown      OPT IN to the graceful Ctrl-C / RAMP_OUT
                              path. DISABLED BY DEFAULT as of
                              2026-05-15: field testing showed the
                              graceful path causes 4-6 s of motor whir
                              on Ctrl-C and the robot still collapses
                              at the end (because MC restarts in
                              PASSIVE_DEFAULT regardless). The hard-
                              exit path is shorter in total motor
                              activity and therefore safer for the
                              actuators. Use this flag only when
                              actively developing the soft-shutdown
                              handoff.
  --no-soft-shutdown          Legacy no-op (kept for backward compat).
                              Soft-shutdown is now off by default.
  --no-confirm                Skip the final "proceed?" prompt (for CI)
  --no-build                  Skip the colcon build step (use the existing
                              install/ tree as-is)
  --build-only                Build, don't run
  --no-docker                 Do NOT auto-relaunch inside the docker_x2/x2sim
                              container. Default behaviour is: if
                              /workspace/sonic doesn't exist (i.e. you're on
                              a host shell), the script re-execs itself
                              inside the container with \$HOME mounted at
                              \$HOME so all your paths just work. Pass this
                              flag if you've already sourced ROS 2 +
                              aimdk_msgs on the host and want to run
                              natively. Also honoured via the
                              X2_DEPLOY_IN_DOCKER=1 env var (set
                              automatically by the auto-relaunch).
  --no-preflight-py           Skip the gantry-aware Python preflight
                              (gear_sonic_deploy/scripts/x2_preflight.py).
                              Default: preflight runs in local/onbot mode
                              and is force-skipped in sim. Failures abort
                              BEFORE MC stop, so the robot stays held.
  --preflight-strict          Run the Python preflight with --strict-pose
                              --strict-effort (promotes pose/effort WARNs
                              to FAIL). Recommended for floor-stand powered
                              runs; leave off for gantry bring-up.
  --preflight-args "..."      Extra args appended verbatim to the Python
                              preflight invocation (e.g.
                              "--max-effort 10 --imu-tilt-deg 12").

ONNX Runtime:
  --onnxruntime-root PATH     ORT install prefix (default: $ONNXRUNTIME_ROOT_DEFAULT)

  # On-bot powered run (split-topology). Must be invoked ON PC2 after
  # pc2_bringup.sh has staged the workspace. Typically launched via
  # scripts/x2_pc2_daemons.sh from the laptop; this is what ends up

# it -- otherwise preflight aborts with "ModuleNotFoundError: rclpy" /
# "ros2 not in PATH" and we never get to the launch dispatch where the
# env used to be sourced.

# Previously this block lived inside the launch dispatch (way too late);
# moving it here means preflight, tuning translator AND the launch all

# MC mode helpers (smooth handoff). These wrap the existing stop_app /

# SetMcAction(STAND_DEFAULT) after start, so the bus transitions are
# softer:
#
#   STAND  -> DAMPING -> stop_app -> deploy publishes -> ...
#   ... -> RAMP_OUT -> start_app -> wait MC up -> STAND
#
# Without these wraps:
#   - stop_app from STAND_DEFAULT cuts the PD-balancing instantly. Motors
#     drop to zero stiffness in one step => visible jolt on the gantry.

# timeout per service call, a few retries, parse action_desc out of the

# without ROS sourced); the deploy still works -- you just lose the smooth
