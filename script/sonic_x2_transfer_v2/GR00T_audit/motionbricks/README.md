MotionBricks is a real-time generative framework that transforms interactive motion control for animation and robotics. By combining a large-scale latent backbone with intuitive "smart primitives," it delivers high-quality, zero-shot motion synthesis at 15,000 FPS, allowing users to effortlessly build complex animations and robotic movements like assembling bricks.

## News & Roadmap

### News

- **2026-04-27** — Initial public release: interactive demo, pretrained checkpoints (VQVAE · pose · root), synthetic training code, motion-representation docs, and GIF gallery.

### Roadmap

- [ ] Full training pipeline inside [GR00T Whole-Body Control](https://github.com/NVlabs/GR00T-WholeBodyControl)'s GEAR-SONIC pipeline — targeted for approximately one month out; reproducibility experiments are already in flight.

## Results

See the [project page](https://nvlabs.github.io/motionbricks) for the full uncut demos and comparison videos. Short clips below are GIFs (muted, ~10 s each).

## Setup

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+, a CUDA-capable GPU, [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/).

### Clone the repository

MotionBricks ships as a subproject of [GR00T Whole-Body Control](https://github.com/NVlabs/GR00T-WholeBodyControl). Clone the parent repo and `cd` into `motionbricks/`. Pretrained checkpoints, mesh assets, and gallery GIFs are tracked with Git LFS, so install LFS before cloning:

```bash
git lfs install
```

The parent repo skips MotionBricks pretrained checkpoints by default so a normal monorepo clone does not automatically download the extra ~2.2 GB of checkpoint files. MotionBricks GIFs and mesh assets still download normally. If you only need source code (for example, to train on your own data), clone normally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVlabs/GR00T-WholeBodyControl.git
cd GR00T-WholeBodyControl/motionbricks
```

If you want the checkpoints for the interactive demo, fetch them explicitly from the repo root:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVlabs/GR00T-WholeBodyControl.git
cd GR00T-WholeBodyControl
git lfs pull --include="motionbricks/out/**" --exclude=""
git lfs pull --include="motionbricks/assets/skeletons/g1/meshes/**" --exclude=""  # needed for interactive demo
cd motionbricks
```

After fetching MotionBricks checkpoints, verify that checkpoint files were downloaded (not tiny Git LFS pointer files):

```bash
ls -lh out/G1-clip.ckpt                                     # ~7.5 MB
ls -lh out/motionbricks_vqvae/version_1/checkpoints/*.ckpt  # ~273 MB
ls -lh out/motionbricks_pose/version_1/checkpoints/*.ckpt   # ~1.6 GB
ls -lh out/motionbricks_root/version_1/checkpoints/*.ckpt   # ~391 MB
```

If these files are unexpectedly small (around 1 KB), they are LFS pointers. From the repo root, run `git lfs pull --include="motionbricks/out/**" --exclude=""` to fetch the actual checkpoints.


### Install dependencies

```bash
# Create environment
conda create -n motionbricks python=3.10 -y
conda activate motionbricks

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# Linux only: needed for keyboard input and MuJoCo key-grab workaround
pip install pynput python-xlib
```

## Interactive Demo: Quick Start

```bash
DISPLAY=:1 python scripts/interactive_demo_g1.py
```

This launches the MuJoCo viewer with the G1 robot. Use your keyboard to control it in real time. Hold the left mouse button and drag to change the camera look-at direction.

</p>

### Movement Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `W` | Move forward |
| `A` | Move left |
| `S` | Move backward |
| `D` | Move right |

The movement direction is relative to the camera. Rotate the camera by right-clicking and dragging in the MuJoCo viewer.

### Motion Styles

| Key | Style |
|-----|-------|
| `V` | Slow walk |
| `Z` | Hand crawling |
| `X` | Walk boxing |
| `B` | Elbow crawling |
| `R` | Stealth walk |
| `T` | Injured walk |
| `C` | Walk stealth (crouched) |
| `E` | Happy dance walk |
| `F` | Zombie walk |
| `G` | Gun walk |
| `Q` | Scared walk |

Note: crawling modes (`Z` hand crawling and `B` elbow crawling) currently do not support side-only directions.

Without pressing a style key, the default locomotion is: **idle** (no movement keys), **walk** (WASD pressed).

## Training

Training scripts are provided for all three model components. The scripts use synthetic data by default and load model configs from the saved checkpoints in `out/`. The full motion datasets are available at <https://bones.studio/datasets>.

**Full release status:** A full release — a model fully embedded in [GR00T whole-body control](https://github.com/NVlabs/GR00T-WholeBodyControl)'s robotics formulation, along with the complete training pipeline — is targeted for approximately one month out. Reproducibility experiments are already in flight; please check back for updates.

```bash
# Train the VQVAE (motion tokenizer)
python scripts/train_vqvae.py

# Train the pose model (requires pretrained VQVAE checkpoint)
python scripts/train_pose.py

# Train the root model (no VQVAE needed)
python scripts/train_root.py
```

### Dataset

The datasets used to train the pretrained checkpoints can be downloaded at <https://bones.studio/datasets>. All current training scripts default to **synthetic data** (see `motionbricks/data/synthetic_dataset.py`) so that the full training pipeline can be verified end-to-end without the real dataset.

## Motion Representation and Custom Datasets

For details on the motion feature representation, skeleton system, coordinate conventions, normalization, and feature computation pipeline, see [docs/motion_representation.md](docs/motion_representation.md).

For a step-by-step guide to training MotionBricks on your own motion data and adapting it to a new robot, see [docs/adding_your_own_dataset.md](docs/adding_your_own_dataset.md).

### AgiBot X2 Ultra (walk / turn planner scope)

X2 skeleton classes, BONES-SEED walk/turn filtering, and training entrypoints live under
[docs/x2_walk_turn_training.md](docs/x2_walk_turn_training.md).

The evaluation harness for the trained planner (per-model isolation tests,
end-to-end velocity sweeps, X2-vs-G1 parity comparison, scripted-demo runner,
dual-skeleton MuJoCo viewer) is documented in
[docs/x2_kplanner_evaluation.md](docs/x2_kplanner_evaluation.md).

## Known Issues

- **Linux/X11 only:** The keyboard key-grab workaround requires X11 (`python-xlib`). On Wayland, macOS, or Windows, some MuJoCo keyboard shortcuts may conflict with the controller keys. Keep the **terminal focused** (not the MuJoCo window) as a workaround.
- **`PYTORCH_JIT=0` disables key grabs:** Running with `PYTORCH_JIT=0` interferes with the X11 key-grab workaround. If you need `PYTORCH_JIT=0`, keep the terminal focused instead.
- The `pynput` package is required for keyboard input on Linux/macOS. On Windows, the `keyboard` package is used instead.
