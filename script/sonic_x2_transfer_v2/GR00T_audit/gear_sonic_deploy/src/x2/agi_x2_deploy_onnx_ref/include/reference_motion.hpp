/**
 * @file reference_motion.hpp
 * @brief Reference-trajectory source for the 680-D tokenizer obs.
 *
 * The X2 g1 tokenizer encoder consumes a 10-frame future-reference window
 * sampled at 0.1 s spacing. Each future frame contributes:
 *   - 31-DOF joint position (IL order)
 *   - 31-DOF joint velocity (IL order)
 *   - 6-D rotation diff (cur_root_rot^-1 * future_root_rot, first two rows
 *     of the matrix)
 *
 * On the real robot we want to swap reference sources without recompiling:
 *   - StandStill  -- always returns DEFAULT_DOF + identity quat (good for
 *                    the first dry-run / standing test on a gantry)
 *   - PklPlayback -- replays a recorded .pkl motion (training data style)
 *   - LiveTopic   -- subscribes to an external command topic (future work)
 *
 * This header defines the abstract interface plus the StandStill default.
 * PklPlayback lives in reference_motion.cpp behind the same interface.

  /// is rotated relative to the motion's heading. On real hardware we can't
  /// teleport; the robot starts with whatever yaw the gantry happens to

  /// world yaw the recording was captured in (often arbitrary -- e.g. ~96
  /// deg for x2_ultra_idle_stand.pkl). The deploy must therefore re-anchor
  /// the motion clip's heading on entry to CONTROL state.
