/**
 * @file wrist_bypass.hpp
 * @brief Surgical override of SONIC's wrist target for the 4 broken DOFs.
 *
 * SONIC's training distribution does not include diverse wrist motion and
 * the smallmotor wrist channels have an x2_action_scale of just 0.0715 (vs
 * ~0.42 elsewhere on the arm), so the policy outputs a near-static comfort
 * pose for ``*_wrist_pitch`` and pins ``*_wrist_roll`` at the asymmetric
 * joint-range tight side regardless of what the IK reference asks for.
 * Empirical proof: ``data/lerobot/x2_quest3_sonic_v2/data/chunk-000/
 * episode_000001.parquet`` shows ``corr(commanded, executed) ~ 0.0`` for
 * both wrist pitches and 98-99% of frames pinned at +-41 deg for both
 * wrist rolls. The same behaviour reproduces on the iter-2k and iter-25k
 * checkpoints, ruling out a training regression.
 *
 * The bypass is CLI-gated (``--wrist-bypass {off,ik,freeze}`` on the deploy
 * binary, default off). When ``ik`` is selected, ``OnControl`` calls
 * ``ApplyWristBypass`` BEFORE the safety stack so soft-start blend,
 * ``--max-target-dev`` clamp, and the tilt-trip force-to-default branch
 * still apply uniformly to the IK-driven target.
 *
 * ``wrist_yaw`` (MJ indices 19 and 26) is intentionally LEFT under SONIC:
 * v2 telemetry shows it tracks the IK reference cleanly (correlation
 * ~0.8), unlike pitch / roll. Override only the four broken DOFs.
 *
 * Lives in its own header so the unit test (``test/test_obs_builder.cpp``)
 * can exercise the override loop without pulling in ROS 2 / ONNX runtime.
