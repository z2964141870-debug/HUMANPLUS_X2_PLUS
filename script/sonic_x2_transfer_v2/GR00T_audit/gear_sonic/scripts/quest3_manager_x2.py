"""X2-specific Quest 3 manager — sibling of ``quest3_manager_thread_server.py``.

This is the manager process for the Phase 0 planner-driven recorder
architecture. It owns the Quest 3 connection, runs the X2 retargeting
stack (calibrated arm IK + per-finger curl + finger filter + thumb
opposition), and publishes three ZMQ streams:

1. ``planner_cmd``  (JSON)    -> ``x2_heuristic_planner.py``
2. ``arm_targets`` + ``hand_finger_cmd`` + ``stream_mode``  (msgpack)
                              -> ``record_x2_dataset.py`` (subscribe-only mode)
3. ``recorder_cmd`` (JSON)    -> ``record_x2_dataset.py`` (episode control)

In Phase 0 the recorder also subscribes to the planner's ``body_pose``
topic and merges ``body_pose`` + ``arm_targets`` -> ``final_pose`` to
the deploy. This manager is the single source of truth for Quest 3
inputs across that pipeline; the recorder no longer touches the
headset.

See ``planner_driven_quest3_recorder_mvp_*.plan.md`` for the full
data-flow diagram.

Wire format
-----------

planner_cmd (ZMQ PUB, multipart):
    frame 0: ``b"planner_cmd"``
    frame 1: utf-8 JSON ``{"intent": str, "magnitude": str}``

arm_targets (ZMQ PUB, msgpack on topic ``arm_targets``):
    ``{"left_q_rad": [7], "right_q_rad": [7], "is_engaged": bool, "tick": int, "ts": float}``

hand_finger_cmd (ZMQ PUB, msgpack on topic ``hand_finger_cmd``):
    ``{"left_hand_q": [10], "right_hand_q": [10], "tick": int, "ts": float}``

stream_mode (ZMQ PUB, msgpack on topic ``stream_mode``):
    ``{"mode": str, "tick": int, "ts": float}``

recorder_cmd (ZMQ PUB, multipart):
    frame 0: ``b"recorder_cmd"``
    frame 1: utf-8 JSON ``{"action": str, "tick": int, "ts": float}``

Buttons (X2 manager-mediated mode)
----------------------------------

- ``A+B+X+Y`` chord: toggle OFF <-> LOCOMOTION (engage / E-stop)
- ``B`` single (only when not OFF): toggle LOCOMOTION <-> ARM_MANIPULATION
- ``A`` single (in ARM_MANIPULATION): toggle arm IK engaged
- ``X`` single (in ARM_MANIPULATION): start episode
  (forwarded to recorder; no-op when not in ARM_MANIPULATION)
- ``Y`` single (in ARM_MANIPULATION): stop & save episode
  (forwarded to recorder; no-op when not in ARM_MANIPULATION)
- Left stick (LOCOMOTION mode): ``fwd_step`` / ``back_step`` / ``side_*``
- Right stick (LOCOMOTION mode): ``turn_left`` / ``turn_right`` (deg_45)
- ``A`` held (LOCOMOTION mode): converts L-stick fwd/back into
  continuous ``walk / forward`` / ``walk / backward``
- ``X`` held (LOCOMOTION mode): upgrades hard R-stick rx into a
  90deg turn (``turn_left / deg_90`` / ``turn_right / deg_90``)
- Y held: was crouch; currently disabled in IntentDecoder

Note: the OmniHand fingers are driven from XRHand curls + thumb
opposition; per-side state freezes on a mode flip into LOCOMOTION so
the operator's relaxed grip during walking doesn't open the hand
mid-grasp.

Sidecar logging
---------------

Per-tick ``planner_cmd`` events are appended to a JSONL file (one line
per emit) so post-hoc analysis can correlate operator intent with the
recorded ``observation.*`` / ``action.*`` columns.

    # hard override on the merged ``pose`` stream the deploy
    # consumes. This is intentional for the ARM_MANIPULATION ->
    # LOCOMOTION arm-hold workflow: the operator positions the arms
    # (e.g. holding a tool) in ARM_MAN, toggles to LOCOMOTION to walk
    # to a new spot, and the arms STAY LOCKED at the manipulation
    # pose for the duration of the walk instead of swinging back to a
    # neutral gait pose. Flipping this default to False would silently
    # break that workflow -- the moment the operator switches from

    #      RSI init orientation, so the bin labelled ``fwd_step``
    #      actually translates the body BACKWARD in world (legs step
    #      forward in body-local frame, but the body's facing is

    #      translates the body FORWARD in world.

    leaves a known footgun -- in ``--with-record`` mode an X press
    while already recording, or a Y press with no active episode,
    will fire the cue (the recorder logs ``ignored`` but the manager
    doesn't see that). Tracked as the "ACK topic" follow-up."""

        on a per-side basis; the caller fills in zeros for any None
        returned here.

        ``source`` is ``"wire"`` on success and ``"neutral"`` otherwise;
        the caller logs both branches so the operator can tell at a
        glance whether the snap-to-wire path actually fired.
