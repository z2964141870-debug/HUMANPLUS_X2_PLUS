/**
 * @file safety.hpp
 * @brief Safety scaffolding for first-real-robot bring-up.
 *
 * Three layers, ordered most-passive to least-passive:
 *
 *   1. DryRun
 *      - Runs the full obs/policy/IO pipeline and PUBLISHES the commands,
 *        but with stiffness=0 and damping=0 so the motors do nothing. Used
 *        to verify wiring (topics, joint name remap, IMU sign convention)
 *        before any torque is applied.
 *
 *   2. SoftStartRamp
 *      - Once the operator says "go", blend the live policy target with the
 *        DEFAULT_DOF standing pose over `ramp_seconds` seconds. Prevents
 *        a sudden jump from the operator-selected start pose to whatever
 *        the policy thinks is "right" on the first inference.
 *
 *   3. TiltWatchdog
 *      - Monitors gravity[2] in body frame (== quat_rotate_inverse(quat,
 *        [0,0,-1])[2]). On the real robot, "upright" means gravity[2] is
 *        approximately -1.0. If it drifts above the configured threshold
 *        (default -0.3, matching eval_x2_mujoco --fall-tilt-cos), the
 *        watchdog trips and the deploy switches to "hold default angles
 *        with high damping" mode (no policy commands). The operator can
 *        then catch the robot manually.
 *
 * All three are pure CPU-side state machines; they do not own any ROS or
 * ONNX resources. The main loop calls them from the 50 Hz control timer.
